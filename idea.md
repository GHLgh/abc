#Motivation
This idea is originated when I was working on another repository called [hello_translator](https://github.com/GHLgh/hello_translator)
where I have multiple markdown files to keep track on multiple things.

And then it occurred to me that it might be cool if I can display the content of different markdown files into readme.md file
which will be parsed and displayed by GitHub automatically. In this case, we can construct the readme.md into seperate files
and it should be easier to update the documentation by modules.

#Project Design
What is my approach to implement the project (this might change over the development of the project)
